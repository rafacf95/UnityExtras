# UnityExtras

This repository is a Unity project created as part of my personal portfolio. Its main goal is to demonstrate practical skills in customizing the engine's editor.

This repository demonstrates modular design, good coding practices, and practical solutions to common problems in Unity development.

## Overview

Unity projects often require small utilities that are reused across multiple games or applications.  
**UnityExtras** centralizes these tools in a single repository, making them easier to maintain and integrate into other projects.

### Examples of Included Content

- Editor tools to speed up development workflows
- Runtime utilities and helper classes
- Common gameplay and system scripts
- Extensions for native Unity components

> The available features depend on the current implementation inside the `Assets` folder.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Editor:** Unity Hub / Unity Editor
